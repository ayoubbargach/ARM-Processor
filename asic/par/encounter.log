**WARN: (ENCEXT-1085):	Option 'rda_Input(ui_res_scale)' used in configuration file 'c35_arm_io.conf' is obsolete. The name will be converted into new format automatically if design is saved and then restored. Alternatively, update the configuration file to use names 'rda_Input(ui_preRoute_res)' and/or 'rda_Input(ui_postRoute_res)' for resistance scale factors to be used at preRoute/postRoute stages of the design . The obsolete name works in this release. But to avoid this warning and to ensure compatibility with future releases, update this option name.
**WARN: (ENCSYT-709):	The next major release of EDI (11.1) will use the
Multi-Mode/Multi-Corner (MMMC) architecture exclusively for configuration and
control of some software features. The current configuration will continue to
work in this release. But for compatibility with the future releases you
should migrate your design to an MMMC style configuration. You can refer to
the What's New document for this release for additional information on the
11.1 migration to MMMC. In addition, you can run loadConfig with the
-showEolWarnings option to identify specific command and configuration
options that will no longer be supported.
